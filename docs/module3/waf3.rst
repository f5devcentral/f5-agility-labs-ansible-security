Validate that WAF is now Blocking injection Attacks
===================================================

After modifying the WAF policy from transparent to blocking the F5 BIG-IP should now be enforcing its protections, specifically to block injection attacks.  This next section will show that the commands previously used will not be accessible anymore as the F5â€™s WAF Policy has the ability to detect and prevent these types of attacks.

#. Re-Run the first injection command to now see that the F5 BIG-IP WAF is blocking the Injection attempt.
     In the DVWA Website in the XRDP Session

#. Re-Enable Transparent WAF Policy via Ansible Script **(Needed for Next Section)**
     In the Ansible Shell
